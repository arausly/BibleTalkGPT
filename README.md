I hold discussions every week on different religious subjects that hopefully engage my audience and strike a thought that would lead to a change of heart. I would have to admit, starting on a blank canvas is always daunting. As a fun, not-so-serious project, I decided to build this. 

Finetuned to adapt to my style of making preparatory notes, particularly in how I structure my lessons and tentative questions. 

There is so much more to be done and this is just the beginning.
