We have this every Friday 7pm.Basically what we do is exchange our opinions for what the Bible has to say on different subject matters.Today’s bible talk is quite a very reflective one for me, and that’s in view of the happenings in the country.As long as you are in this country you have definitely felt the weight of the economy one shape or form. Rich or poor every body is in a state of uncertainty.Our division is killing us, we are so corrupt we don’t see that we are eating our very foundation.Question oneAnd so I started to question myself, where do you see this country going in 8-10 years and what kind of future do you think that would be for you?Follow up to Question oneDo you think there is anything you can do to make things better?Perhaps for yourself or even better for the collective good?Interlude to setup the first scriptureAs a Christian we do not conform to the world, doesn’t mean that we don’t feel what the world feels, that would be you lying to yourself. Which is pathetic, the scripture says Abraham faces the facts that he was old… what I do is find relatability within scriptures to help change my perspective.So that’s what we are going to do, let’s look at JohnMatthew 11:1-2Question 2Why do you think John the Baptist asked this question.Points about John.1. Baptizer himself2. Elijah himself3. The greatest of all men born of a woman.4. A prophet and forerunner of Christ.Not so great points1. He was a prisoner for about 2 years2. Never did a single miracle a day in his life3. Goes to jail for preaching the truth.John couldn’t reconcile the fact that God himself was here on earth and he was in captivity. From verse 6 we see that he was offended.Perhaps we are similarly offended as well, I talk to people about joining this conversation and they tell me that’s not what’s doing me now.John’s statement at his lowest was peak human behavior. We are very quick to look for a new Saviour, a new messiah, a new king.I think of during the election, we all wanted Peter obi to save us, but very quick we found out that even Peter obi couldn’t save himself from the corruption that in this country.Then against all hope we did hope on Tinubu, but off course, you will be insane to still hold to that. Then Dangote and his refinery, only to hear that he is a business man, fuel price is not coming down.The problem is this very pursuit blinds us. Let’s look at another example of people looking for another thing order than what God had to offer.Act 1:3-6.Why do you think they asked this questionPoints.1. Jesus had literally suffered, went on the cross and resurrected.2. Still stayed back for 40days talking about the Kingdom and heaven and yet they still wanted what was in their hearts.Jesus saw the bigger picture, they were trying to get things from Jesus. He wanted them to be like him (Christ-like) so they can do even greater things.Because if everybody is like Jesus nobody will be in captivity.So what should we do then… how should we respond?Matt 4:4Live by the word.Today people are living by the world, by what’s popular.Jesus says follow the narrow path, meaning it’s going to be rare, it’s not going to be so popular.Think about it, if I’m the devil and something isn’t necessarily a threat why would I oppose it. I would probably make it bigger so many people can be deceive and so there’s no one left to oppose me."}]}

If you want to be a policeman today, you have to be able to ask for bribes. I hear some units even have quota. It’s probably even part of their JD2. Sales, you have to lie.Hmmm… thanks for your responses. It’s fascinating how people live their lives that way but more shocking just like the Eunuch how these same people head right straight to church as if nothing happened.I heard a story of a lady that after she had finished fornicating during the evening, she woke up to do her midnight prayers.Like what, God is a God of mercy, but he is definitely not the God of deception. You have him confused with Loki or something.Lead to a question in my heart.What is the recommended distance from your house to a place you call your church?Max 1 hour, 2 hour….Back to the text, we read that he was going to Jerusalem.Flat out this person was a radical person.He was willing to go extreme both ways (worldly and spiritually). People want to extreme worldly and conservative spiritually.Would have taken him several weeks, 1598.32 miles.Vs 28-34What’s the correlation between Isaiah, good news and Baptism.Romans 6:17. Give your allegiance to the pattern of teaching."}]}

And the day of atonement.Anything difficult to attain is valuable to have.Imagine that same friend that you are used to pacifying or appeasing by buying gifts when you offend him or her says, instead of buying gifts, I have bought a bunch of gifts cards.Again how will that make you feel, especially because you have gotten into the routine of buying gifts?Would that make you offend more?"}]}

I was going to ask a question of how differently we would do things if we were God, but I’m sure because of the books of Genesis, we would just copy.So I decided to choose something also equally terrible to start off with and that is Nigeria, we can all agree that nothing works, right? So if you were God, how would you fix this country to make it fantastic? And in what order?Genesis 6:13-16Noah and the ArkWas it more necessary to be in the ark that God specified or to be in ark when the flood came? What if you were in a bigger ark than the arkNoah built, do you think you might have had a chance of survival? Consensus: so it was necessary for Noah to follow the exact specifications from God. Exodus 25:8-11&40Why do you think God was particular about the pattern He showed Moses?Answer Heb 8:5Let’s read vs 6Would the new superior covenant be any different in serving for the spiritual realities. The new covenant was very established on His Church, right? Do you think there is a pattern to God’s church?It is God’s pattern that makes the ark the right ark, not Noah. It is the God’s pattern that makes the tabernacle the right tabernacle not Moses. So the question I put to you even as we conclude:A church that doesn’t follow God’s pattern, is it the right church?But the great issue here is if we don’t know God’s pattern can we identify the right church? The right church is not the church closest to you, it’s not the church with the biggest auditorium, it’s not the church with good choir, it’s not the church with nice and good looking people, it’s the church that is built with God’s pattern?"}]}

Is this scripture true because God cannot sin, or because he could sin, however he chose not too?Hebrews 4:15Was Jesus really tempted in all things as the Bible says? 1. He never was stopped by Lastma/police and had to drop money. 2. He didn’t have the internet with all of the temptations that come with it. Jesus is God right? When the Bible speaks about the fact that he was without sin though tempted in alil thingsDo you think he was without sin because he was incapable of committing sin being God or because He overcame every possible temptation and hence did not sin?I WANT US TO READ VS 16, ALSO GET FEEDBACK. So we see in vs 15, how the Bible talks about the high priest which is Jesus, in other references it refers to Jesus as brother and interestingly as a friend. In this scripture what is most fascinating is how the Bible paints Jesus as very empathetic, relatable, which makes Jesus not just a friend but the perfect friend, think about it, ever had that friend that just gets you, you have to be anything around them but yourself, before you finish saying A, they say B. Jesus our perfect friend is that person. But also the Bible refers to Jesus as the Lion of the tribe of Judah to signify his qualities of strength, fierceness and capable violence as with any Lion.And this is why In the Old Testament there were layers of interactions with God, it couldn’t be direct. What we see in vs 16 is the encouragement in-spite of that fierceness to approach Jesus as you would a friend. The question really is how do we come to him, Start by getting on contact with the person who invited you. Ever heard of the statement, the friend of my friend is my friend also, the person who invited you to a bible discussion is most like a friend of The perfect friend, so it would be good to get aquatinted. So to answer the icebreaker question I would choose the Lion but not any Lion, but the Lion of the tribe of Judah"}]}

I was on YouTube the other day and there someone was giving a distinction between Judaism and Christianity. He said that Judaism is set a practices that people live by, whereas Christianity is a set of believes that people live by. His support to this theory was the fact that there are 613 laws for those who practice Judaism, for the Christians we have 10 commandments, and some by Jesus which was an expansion of the 10 commandments and then the apostles which is just an expansion of what Jesus has already said. So I guess for me, I started to think, was Jesus’s concern more on believe than of practices. Hence our discussion todayIs Christianity more of practices than believes or vice versa. first questionMatt 5:28, Jesus speaking, He says “But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”And so my first question, since the subject issue here is the issue of adultery, is it possible for a single man based on this scripture to commit adultery?Is the ban or what Jesus is trying to prevent the practice of adultery or the idea of adultery/ thinking of/desire? Is the idea of doing something bad as bad the deed itself, conversely is the idea of doing something good as good as doing it?If what you claim is that the idea of adultery is as bad as having it, then, we can scale that to just about everything. The goal is to create a connecting line between thoughts, desire, believes and what you do. 1 Timothy 4:16What your life and your doctrine, affirming that there is indeed a line between thoughts, desire, believes and what you do. If your believes are wrong, are your practices right and if your practices are wrong are your believes rights? it’s a catch 22 situation. My believe in God is in. John 8:31-32It’s not what you do, but it’s about the motives m What validates your Christian. "}]}

Examples: 1. Watching pornography instead of having sex, you tell yourself it’s okay because you didn’t do the “real” thing, but in actual fact you commit another grievous sin. 2. Has opposed to having confrontation with the intent to do harm, you instead, do way worse by engaging in slanderous gossips and defamation acts. 3. Instead of doing something wrong, like going out to hangout with your friends (clubs) you lie about an impromptu engagements. From Gen 19: 9-11. Can you identify the two sins, the one Lot tried to avoid and the second one he introduced as an alternative?Question 2. What are the permissive views of society that contradict divine laws?Examples:1. Sex before marriage. 2. Cohabitation during courtship.3. Bribery.4. Maltreatment of domestic staffs.5. Lying on your CV e.g Forging your work experience.Follow up question to the above. What are the permissive views of the churches you have attended or know that clearly contradict the Bible?Examples: 1. Put your hand on your chest or touch the TV and say the sinner’s prayer. 2. Bring your ATM to church and place it on the altar. 3. Drink sand from holy ground.4. Mantle (you could find a reference in bible, but there is no clear injunction to the new dispensation. Even if there was, definitely not how it is used today. What eventually now happens is, we miss the divine for the superficial)Genesis 19:15-17Staying around sin and expecting not to be consumed is like settling in a dump site, in the midst of the dirt and expecting not to stink.it’s one thing to not know the truth and live a lie all your life (which is a category some of us might be, I say might because we could be oblivious to our current state a lot times, which is why I would like to encourage you to study the bible) and also in the same line of thought it’s even worse to know the truth and yet not live the truth.

Good person = Righteous manBad person = sinner manHow many good people do you think we have in the world today?Romans 3:23 tells us that we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. So effectively we are all sinners. All have sinned = All are bad. If you want to know how practical this scripture is every single creature was wiped out in the flood that happened in Noah’s time except him and 7 of his family members. Do you think it is right to consistently do wrong things and not go unpunished?Proverbs 17:15God hates punishing the good man and would love to punish the bad man. So what have we seen here? We know that a good person is a righteous person. And that, we are all bad people fundamentally and finally, we are evidently going to be punished. And so what shall we do?2 Corinthians 5:211. Him who knew no sin- here we find out Jesus is a good man, in fact Mark 10:18, Luke 18:19 tells us that he is the only good man.2. It is only in Christ we can become good in the eyes of God. And so the question do good people end up in heaven? The answer from our study is yes, good people, righteous people, people without sin end up in heaven.The only problem is there just only one good person, and that is Jesus! And it is only being in Him that can make us good in the eyes of God. And so when next you wonder about anybody, whether or not they are in heaven the question is did this person live In Christ the biblical way, not the “grace covers all”way and did this person die in Christ also. This is bibletalk, there is a lot of unpacking yet to be done. Please reach out to the person that invited you. "}]}

Romans 3:23We can clearly see that all men have sinned and have fallen short of the glory of God.So there is nobody that has never done anything wrong. You could do wrong by doing wrong and also you could do wrong by not doing right?Possible follow up question. Can you also tell me a time when you did not do what you knew was the right thing to do. James 4:17. So we see also where that when we don’t do the good we know we ought to do we are in sin. So we see clearly that we can be a sinner by what we do and what we don’t do.Question 2.What are the qualities that make a good person?Romans 5:7. We see something interesting here, the word righteous is used interchangeably with the wordgood, used to describe the same individual. And conversely, the word “sinner” in v8 is used to refer to the opposite of a good and righteous man. We have seen that we were all sinners and that we can only be good when we are righteous. Matt 5:20. Only the righteous will enter the kingdom of God. "}]}
